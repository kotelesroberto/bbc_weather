Weather application for BBC


## Instructions
**Web Developer Test - BBC.com**

Web Developer recruitment test for roles at BBC.com http://www.bbc.com

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It consists of two parts:

- Create a GitHub repository ([help](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world))
- Develop a web application

The test is designed to assess your interest and experience in web development. We want to see your code, your approach and your talent.

**Task requirements**

The task is to create a responsive web application that you can use to see the weather in one of 5 prelisted locations: London, Paris, New-York, Singapore and Sydney. 
The application should display the following information:

- Location
- Current weather summary
- Current weather temperature
- Current weather icon

To get the weather data, we recommend using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs), signing up is free (no need to enter any bank details).

One of the requirements is to keep your commits atomic. Keep them small so it is easier for us to review your code and see each incremental change. Once you're done, create a Pull Request and send us the link to your repo.

**User Stories**

```
  As a user
  When I visit the page
  I want to see a list of locations
  So that I know which locations are available
```

```
  As a user
  When I select a location
  I want to see the current weather
  So that I know what the weather is for the location I selected
```

**What you need to build**

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met:

- Please complete the user stories
- Your code should compile and run in one step

While solving the problem correctly is important this is an opportunity to show how you would go about structuring a solution to the problem.

You can create the application in any of the following languages: PHP, JavaScript, Java, Ruby or Python. Feel free to use whatever frameworks, libraries and packages you like.

That's it. We leave the design and user-experience to you.

**What we're looking for**

- Completeness of solution: does the app work as per the requirements?
- Quality of code: is your code clean?
- User interface: does the page look ok? is it easy to use?

**Final words**

We hope you enjoy building a BBC weather application. We're interested in your feedback, so do let us know what you thought of the task. 

Good luck!
